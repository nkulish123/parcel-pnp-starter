                <h1>A Review of HTML</h1>
                <p>
                    HTMl is really a very simple scripting language. It consists of ordinary text, with elements that are enclosed by "<" and ">" characters.<br />
                    The best part of HTML is that once we know how to effectively use basic elements, we can look up how to use all of the others!

            <h3><u>Links</u></h3>
            <p>Links are very useful, and help users to quickly navigate to new pages, both within and outside of the current website.</p>
            <p>For instance, they can quickly direct users to <a href="https://www.google.com/">Google's Homepage.</a></p>
            <p><a href="emailto:natekulish@gmail.com">Emails</a> can also easily be sent through the use of links.</p>
            <p><a href="#top">They can even bring user to a certain place within a webpage.</a></p>

            <p>
                Sometimes we want to go ahead and align pictures to the left of a line of text. Using the "align" attribute, with a value of "left" is a <br/>perfect way to do this. You could also align the picture to the right of text by replacing the
                value in the "align" attribute to "right".
